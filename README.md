# About
 This NES cartridge clears the consoles RAM to match the FCEUX/Bizhawk emulators default RAM pattern.

 The main use for this is console verifying TASes for NES games with uninitialized RAM.

 This was showcased in the TASBlock GDQx 2023, where this cartridge was used.

# Compiling the ROM
 Simply drag the RAMClear.asm file over nesasm.exe, or run "nesasm.exe RAMClear.asm" in a command prompt.
